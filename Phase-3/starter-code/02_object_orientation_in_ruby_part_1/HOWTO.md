# How To Use The Code in this repo:

## Commands

- `rspec` - runs all specs
- `rspec --f-f` - runs specs until the first failure
- `./bin/console` opens a console with access to all the code you have in the lib directory.

## Files

- `computer.rb` - define your computer class and methods to pass tests in this file.
- `playground.rb` - if you want to play around with something that isn't directly related to the lecture, this is a good place to put that code. (Just be careful that it doesn't do something that would interfere with your other code. A syntax error in this file will break the specs.)
- `intro_to_object_oriented_ruby.rb` - this file requires pry and then loads all of the code inside of the `lib/intro_to_object_oriented_ruby.rb` file.
